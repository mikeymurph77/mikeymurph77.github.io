Github just recently quietly released a new feature to their platfom which gives users the opportunity to create a README.md file to display when visitors hit your profile page.

## Creating a Github Profile README
- create a new repo with the same name as your Github username (similar to github pages without the .github.io)
- once the repo is created, simply add a README.md file to the root of the project repo. (you can do this locally or on the Github website)
- The README file uses Github's flavored markdown syntax [markdown cheat-sheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Once you have something that you're ready to share, commit the changes and visit your github.com/<username> and see your creation!

Notes:
- Keep it simple (no walls of text)
- Keep in mind that this section will show above your git graph and pinned repos
- Have fun with it (these a lot of interesting tools out there to jazz up the look and feel)
- Even though this is a markdown file doesn't mean you can't use html tags.


Pretty neat right? I thought so and quickly tossed together a quick

Think about it as an extended bio section where you can display additional information extending past your name, location, and company.

After tinkering around with this feature, I found myself looking at my old blog template to see if I could freshen up the site.
One thing led to another, and I decided to start a fresh and clean portfolio site and blog. One that I could build from scratch, so I could have total control on how things looked and felt.
And so here we are. A brand new site, where my first blog post is about the inspiraction that led me down this path.

Not trying to sound too serendipidious, but I'm happy with the results and may one day write a post about the steps I took to create this site. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
