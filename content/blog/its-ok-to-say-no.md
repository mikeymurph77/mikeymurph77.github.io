Here's some advice. It's ok to say 'No'.

<!-- If I was to go back in time and give myself some advice when I started taking on larger projects, the first thing I would tell myself is that it's ok to say 'no.' -->

Now I'm not raising a counter-argument to 'The Power of Yes' philosophy. Instead, this simple response was something that took some time to learned when I began taking on larger projects at work.

<!-- This simple response is not a counter-argument to 'The Power of Yes' philosophy. However, when used correctly, 'No' is a logical, thought-out answer that can save time and increase value. -->

When properly used, 'No' can keep a project on schedule. Projects tend to grow in scope, requirements, and features. The team lead needs to be the person who draws a line in the sand to say, "We need to focus on A, B, and C before we start working on X, Y, and Z".

Remember that it's ok to plan for future features, but always keep in mind that a team has a max velocity before burning out. Be sure you're gauging what the team can handle at any given moment. It's your responsibility to complete projects you commit your team to, and saying 'No' when you realize the team cannot take on additional work is better than overcommitting and missing deadlines.

Saying 'No' to specific technical approaches and suggestions is also a situation you may find yourself in from time to time. For instance, it may sound like a good idea to migrate a legacy product to a modern language or framework. However, the technical effort may be more costly than the product is worth to the company.

## You Are a Stakeholder

Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) could be considered a controversial writer, and he may tend to romanticize the Software Engineer profession at times. Still, I found this excerpt to be a good reminder that programmers are not just 'Code Monkeys'; we should have the freedom to express our thoughts regarding the code we write.

> ... it is the responsibility of the software development team to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features... Remember, as a software developer, you are a stakeholder. You have a stake in the software that you need to safegaurd... it's a big part of why you were hired.

So remember, you're not just a cog in a wheel. You have a voice as a stakeholder, so speak up when you believe something might not be worth working on at that moment.

It's worth noting that your objection to a decision may not stop the work. There may be instances when 'No' is not an option due to external, technical, or legal requirements. It's always ok to voice your objections, but remember that there are times when your veto does not change the outcome.

## Working Example

A new product idea has just been presented to you. It's an exciting product that will add a lot of value to the company, and it's unlike anything the company or the competition has ever done before. You are excited to hear about this product, but your head starts to spin regarding the technical challenges you and your team will face. Lastly, this new product's rollout has an aggressive deadline that already seems to be fast approaching.

As the team lead, your first responsibility is to break this product down into subtasks and milestones. As you do so, you begin to see some areas of concern that will undoubtedly cause the product to miss its deadline. Your initial reaction is to throw your hands up and alert the company that the product is not feasible.

That is the wrong approach!

We know that everything on the list will not be delivered on time, so the next best path forward is to figure out how to provide something that will still offer value in time for launch.

Alternative approaches will need to be discussed; features may need to wait until after the initial release or wholly removed.

Your responsibility is to maintain communication with business owners, project managers, and upper management on how their ideas can transform into an actual product. The alternatives and cuts mentioned above must be in constant conversation. However, never mention the deletion of a feature without bringing evidence or an alternative approach to the discussion.

If a feature request requires most of the team's time and effort, but the payoff is small, this feature may not be the most impactful work for the team or the product. Make this clear to business owners and discuss these tradeoffs.

The product may have evolved since its initial introduction, and that's ok. Ideas and their results often have areas of deviations. What's essential is you worked closely with all participants, made compromises, and delivered a product that brings value to the company.

## Wrapping Up

Being clear about what can and cannot get done is essential, especially when other individuals or groups depend on your results.

Saying 'No' is an art form that can spoil a working relationship with business owners if you continuously say 'No' and do not provide alternative solutions. Not saying 'No' will display your lack of leadership and ability to get projects done. There is a balance that must be kept. If you can maintain this balance, you'll earn respect from all your peers.
