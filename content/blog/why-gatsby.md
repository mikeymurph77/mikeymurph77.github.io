## What is Gatsby?

> A free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

Sound like they're casting a pretty wide net with the above statement, but after flying through their tutorial, it became clear just how versitile Gatsby could be not only for bootstrappers but for full-blown web applications.

Gatsby checked all the boxes for me personally:

**Great Documentation**
It's

**Lightning Fast**
React && GraphQL
JAMstack - CDN

**Active and Large Community**


**Easily Customizable**
React build exactly what you want/need
Starters and Plugins



I hate to say it now, but I'm pretty sure I vocally laughed when I read the above summary. It's as if they're saying Gatsby can do everything presentational when it comes to web development. I was curious, so I thought I would give the first few sections of the [Gatsby Turtorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) a try to better understand what the above summary truly meant. And yes

I saw this and was optimisticly currious. I've been working in React for a bit now and have been hearing a lot about the JAMstack.



 was at the mercy of what that particular theme had to offer.
