What better way to start this brand-spankin' new site with a genuine and heartfelt "Hello World." It's so cheesy and maybe a little humdrum, but I'm alright with that.

I've been building websites and blogs for almost ten years, and over time have thrown out more than a handful of personal sites.

But this one feels different.

In the past, my sites have been built using various platforms and technologies (Blogger, WordPress, Jekyll, Hexo, etc.). Then I'd pick an off the shelf theme and bada bing, bada boom, we had ourselves an unoriginal site!

That is until I found Gatsby, the static site generator built on top of React and GraphQL.

Now I can go on about Gatsby, and why it has piqued my interest, however, I'll save that as a follow-up post. In short, I ended up loving it so much that scrapping my old site and building exactly what I wanted, theme and all, was the yellow brick road I wanted to go down.

I mentioned that this site is built exactly to my needs and desires! Gone are the days of being limited to whatever theme I downloaded and the features included with them. If I want a feature, custom page, or anything else original, I now have the liberty to build it myself.

At the time of writing this post, I am still figuring out what I want this site to be. Do I keep this 100% professional, or do I incorporate other passions I have besides coding into this site? That has yet to be determined. I know that I will be more active on this site than I have on previous iterations. I feel too proud of this site to let it sit and rot.

We'll see where we go from here, but let me start it all off with a sincere greeting; Hello World ðŸ‘‹!
