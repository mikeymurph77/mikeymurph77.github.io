What better way to start off this new site with a true and heartfelt "Hello World". It's so cheesy and maybe a little humdrum, but I'm alright with that.

I've been making websites and blogs for almost 10 years now, and have thrown out more than a handful of personal sites since.

But this one feels different.

In the past my personal blogs have been built using various platforms and technolgies (blogger, wordpress, jekyll, hexo, etc.). Then I'd just pick an off the shelf theme and bada bing, bada boom, we had ourselves an unoriginal site!

That is until I found Gatsby, the static site generator built on top of React and GraphQL.

Now I can and will go on about Gatsby and why it has peeked my interest, but I'll save that as a follow up post. But in short, I ended up loving it so much that scrapping my old site and building exactly what I wanted, theme and all, was the yellow brick road I wanted to go down.

I mentioned that this site is built exactly to my needs and desires! Gone are the days of being limited to whatever theme I downloaded.

At the time of writing this post, I am still in the process of figuring out what I want this site to be. Do I keep this 100% professional, or do I incorporate other passions I have besides coding in this site. That has yet to be determined. But what I do know is that I will be more active on this site than I have on previous itterations. I feel too proud of this site to let it sit and rot.

We'll see where we go from here, but let me start it all off with an honest and heartfelt greeting; Hello World ðŸ‘‹!
