## About

Finally, remember your New Year's resolutions this year with this stupid-simple tool! Resolution Tracker will send a monthly email reminder so you can continue to pursue the best version of you throughout the entire year!

So let’s be real, can you remember the resolutions you made last year? If you’re like me, the answer is a laughable “NO”!

I built Resolution Tracker a week before 2019 began to try out for a year with friends and family. After some feedback and encouragement, I opened Resolution Tracker to anyone who wanted to improve themselves and keep the promises that they made at the start of the year.

With Resolution Tracker, you will get a monthly reminder email, which will help you stay focused on what's important to you! You can always go back and update or comment on your resolutions!

It's that simple, and I hope you find it useful!
